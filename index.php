<div id="content">
	<p>This year's Christmas Holiday's Steam gifting is being ran by Apollo, VitaminT and Duckling.</p>
	<p>Last year's gifting was said to be very successful, for what we've  achieved this year not only have we surpassed it but we've smashed last year's record by several times. We've gifted more games than anyone could have ever imagined and it's all thanks to you all that participated!</p>
	<p>While not every game or gift is accounted for so far on this website (I still need to get all the data from everyone), you can get a quick idea of what has been accumulated so far. Apollo has amassed an estimated total spent between all of us this Christmas being a grand total of <i><b>$7823 USD!!!</b></i> Obviously this is estimated as those of us in other countries have paid more or less per game as equivalent to the currency exchange, but nevertheless it's a crazy amount!</p>
	<p>Just want to thank everyone for getting into the festive season and for being good natured people and gifting to those that least expect it!</p>
